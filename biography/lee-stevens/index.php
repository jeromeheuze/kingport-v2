                    <p>Lee Stevens focuses on resource productivity as a strategy to enhance sustainability.</p>
                    <p>In energy planning and management, she combines the ENERGY STAR® For Buildings and Plants
                        methodology with her finance and marketing background.</p>
                    <p>Since 2008, Lee develops programs for clients to enhance resource efficiency and maximize
                        financial targets. In 2016, Lee added solutions to address water-energy- food nexus as defined
                        by the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization.</p>
                    <p>Lee believes investments in energy, water and total resource efficiency can be evaluated in a
                        similar manner to any capital projects using discounted cash flow analysis, risk/return
                        analysis; the same due diligence, adjustments for risks and time value of money must be applied.
                        In addition, performance, financial and other commercial risks must be assessed for any resource
                        efficiency project in accordance with capital investment analysis.</p>
                    <p>Her interest in water productivity and water-energy nexus has led her to incorporate water
                        efficiency strategies and solutions in her consulting work. Lee began in 2007 with combined
                        water-energy-chemical efficiency solution using ozone-based technology. She recommends the US
                        EPA WaterSense&nbsp;program to her clients needing water-saving devices inside and outside of
                        buildings.</p>
                    <p>As a subcontractor to Emerging Technologies Associates, Inc. (ETA), Kingport was involved in the
                        following projects:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Develop marketing plan and public outreach for resource efficient technologies,</li>
                        <li>Assessment of energy efficiency of several clients‘ real estate portfolios and
                            sustainability.
                        </li>
                        <li>In 2016, consult on an RFP for district-wide energy efficiency projects of the San Diego
                            Unified School under for Proposition 39 energy efficiency projects.
                        </li>

                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The ENERGY STAR- labeled hospital is one of several hospitals that Lee has assisted with the
                        ENERGY STAR approach to energy management and plan.</p>
                    <p>Lee’s work with Sharp Healthcare System contributed to ETA being recognized by US EPA on their
                        website with the publication of a success story on the ENERGY STAR website at, <a
                                href="https://www.energystar.gov/ia/partners/downloads/Success_Story_ETA.pdf">https://www.energystar.gov/ia/partners/downloads/Success_Story_ETA.pdf</a>
                    </p>
                    <p>Sharp Chula Vista Medical Center received its first ENERGY STAR Award in 2009 with Lee’s help. In
                        2012, VA Loma Linda Medical Center also received an ENERGY STAR award after its energy
                        performance was verified by ETA. As a result of the energy benchmarking projects though the
                        joint effort of Kingport and ETA with several ENERGY STAR Partners, ETA was awarded Outstanding
                        Achievement as an ENERGY STAR Service Provider.</p>
                    <p>Lee joined San Diego-based Emerging Technologies Associates in 2008 as a project coordinator on
                        energy efficiency assessment projects for San Diego Gas &amp; Electric &amp; Company,
                        the San Diego - based utility company. She participated in an assessment of&nbsp;a Direct
                        Digital Occupancy-based Control of Heating Ventilation Air Conditioning systems for hotel guest
                        rooms.&nbsp;Having performed a previous assessment for an international hotel chain and a
                        developer of extended stay corporate housing, Lee was able to bring her knowledge of the
                        technology and hotel management needs to ensure the completion of the project. More information

                    <p>Lee began working with the ENERGY STAR® program in 2007. Using the energy performance
                        benchmarking methodology, she has designed simple strategic plans allowing the roll out of
                        energy and water management strategies and programs for her clients.&nbsp;Many of her clients
                        have been successful at reducing their energy use with&nbsp;Lee's help in establishing&nbsp;quantifiable
                        baselines in their buildings' consumption.&nbsp;Five buildings totaling three million square
                        feet, excluding parking, received the ENERGY STAR labels since 2009. She adopted&nbsp;the "whole
                        building"&nbsp;approach used by the program to help clients use energy more efficiently, to&nbsp;train&nbsp;two&nbsp;large
                        hospital groups as well as a Fortune 100 client on the&nbsp;ENERGY STAR program and its
                        benefits.</p>
                    <p>Lee assisted Emerging Technologies Associates, Inc. in energy performance benchmarking training
                        of clients and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric customers in seminars at the Energy Innovation
                        Center. Lee and Daryl DeJean designed the curriculum and course materials and taught six
                        seminars on the basics of a building energy performance; in addition, Lee created the curriculum
                        for five other seminars on best practices, tools and resources to reduce energy use for small to
                        medium size businesses, organizations, government agencies and service providers throughout San
                        Diego County. Lee benchmarked 98 buildings for a total of 13.9 million square feet with
                        attendees in hands on seminars.</p>
                    <p>The three investor-owned California utility companies and other stakeholders engaged Daryl
                        DeJean, founder of Emerging Technologies Associates Inc. and Lee to develop and teach the Market
                        Drivers and Project Financing curriculum for the statewide training and certification program,
                        The California Advanced Lighting Control Training Program (CALCTP). The CALCTP program created
                        for the electrical contracting industry has received national recognition as an innovative Green
                        Workforce Development initiative and was&nbsp;awarded in January 2010 a Federal Grant to expand
                        the program beyond the State of California. Lee developed and taught the " Financing Energy
                        Efficiency Projects" module of the course statewide from 2009 until 2016.</p>
                    <p>In 2011, Daryl DeJean of Emerging Technologies Associates Inc. and Lee Stevens were retained by
                        the Labor Management Cooperation Committee of IBEW-NECA California to create a training program
                        for business sales executives to sell energy efficiency projects. The training project was
                        followed by a statewide outreach to all members and public relations and marketing campaign to
                        all stakeholders to build awareness of CALCTP with building owners and other stakeholders and
                        increase adoption of advanced lighting technologies across CA.</p>
                    <p>Lee worked in 2010 with The Mark Twain House &amp; Museum in Hartford, CT in tracking its
                        energy performance to determine the benefits of a total LED lighting retrofit with the first
                        generation of the emerging lighting technology. The benchmarking verified the energy savings of
                        multiple measures from changes in staff’s best practices to lighting and HVAC retrofits. The
                        Museum was recognized by ENERGY STAR in a Success Story published on <a
                                href="https://www.energystar.gov/buildings/tools-and-resources/energy-star-success-story-mark-twain-house-museumZa">ENERGY
                            STAR website</a>.</p>
                    <p>In 2007, she assisted Hilton Hotels Corporation&nbsp;in evaluating and implementing a new ozone
                        based technology that saves water, natural gas, electricity and supplies at the same time in a
                        pilot test at Hilton Minneapolis: the technology&nbsp;was adopted by the chain as a potential
                        energy efficiency technology.</p>
                    <p>Lee was interviewed for an article published in the Sacramento Business Journal entitled “<a
                                href="https://www.bizjournals.com/sacramento/stories/2008/06/23/focus2.html">Room (for
                            greener) service</a>” by Robert Celaschi June 20, 2008, at the request of University of
                        California Davis - California Lighting Technology Center, to describe trends in the adoption of
                        energy efficiency technologies in the hotel industry.</p>
                    <p>Lee was named the first New Product Development Manager for Bank of America World Banking
                        Division in 1984 and led several successful new product introductions globally working with
                        account managers on turning existing one off bank&nbsp;transactions into entire products. &nbsp;In
                        her capacity as Vice President in charge of New Product Development at Bank of America Strategic
                        Planning &amp; Development Department, she was instrumental in developing strategic new products
                        and systems that gave the Bank a competitive advantage upon the deregulation of the financial
                        services industry. Lee and her colleagues reviewed new product ideas from Bank of America's
                        entire World Banking Division and selected products that fit strategically in the Bank's growth
                        and profitability objectives.&nbsp;She coordinated teams of project managers from Management
                        Information Systems, stock brokerage, operations departments and line managers. She managed
                        market surveys, product training and presentation that are critical in product launches.&nbsp;Several
                        of the financial systems that she helped bring to market are still in use. The Integrated
                        Overdraft Credit Facilities and Customer Initiated&nbsp;Automated Remote&nbsp;Letter of Credit
                        System&nbsp;that is used globally by banks, originated from&nbsp;the new product development
                        projects that New Product Development Manager at Bank of America Strategic Planning Group in San
                        Francisco. Due to the strategic&nbsp;nature&nbsp;of&nbsp;Product Management, her area was headed
                        by one of the&nbsp;Executive Vice President reporting directly to the&nbsp;CEO of the Bank. This
                        allowed Lee to&nbsp;look at&nbsp;the&nbsp;entire bank and&nbsp;its product portfolio
                        strategically deriving key sub-strategies&nbsp;for entries into niche markets that heretofore
                        were overlooked by the Bank.</p>
                    <p>The product strategies also required a realignment of marketing groups to&nbsp;common goals to
                        ensure the successful launches of new products or re-positioning of existing products.</p>
                    <p>As a member of the team sent to Seattle to develop the Pacific Northwest market, Lee worked with
                        the Bank's senior management during the acquisition of Seafirst Bank in migrating new banking
                        products between parent and subsidiary while helping facilitate the merging of different
                        corporate cultures: the acquisition was one of Bank of America's most profitable and successful
                        acquisitions. While with First Interstate Bank's Merchant Banking Group, Lee developed creative
                        relationship-enhancing strategies with key Fortune 500 companies.</p>
                    <p>Lee received her Bachelor of Arts from Wellesley College, Mass. and her Master of Business
                        Administration in Marketing and Finance from Columbia University Graduate School of Business in
                        New York in 1976. As an undergraduate Biology major, she has a keen interest in the use of
                        applied science to improve the standard of living for all and maximize resource productivity
                        globally.</p>
                    <p>Lee was a voting&nbsp;member of Product Development Management Association (PDMA) and participate
                        in PDMA Los Angeles conferences where she continued to develop strategies for launching emerging
                        resource efficient technologies.</p>
                    <p>Lee joined as a voting member ASTM International Committee E60 on Sustainability, Committee E06
                        on Performance of Buildings and Committee D18 on Soil and Rock from 2009 to 2017. She
                        co-authored and presented a paper entitled “How ASTM E06.81 Standards Promote a Meeting of the
                        Minds”. <a href="https://www.astm.org/DIGITAL_LIBRARY/STP/PAGES/STP158620140031.htm">The paper
                            was published in August 2014</a>.</p>
                    <p>In April 2009, Lee Stevens participated in the Workshop Toward Product Standards for
                        Sustainability&nbsp;organized by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) with the
                        support of the US EPA. The workshop brought together 340&nbsp;stakeholders representing standard
                        developing organizations, consortia, industry, government and consumer groups to focus on issues
                        related to sustainability and environmental performance standards for products.</p>
                    <p>With today's consumers shopping with sustainability in mind,&nbsp;the concepts of green and
                        socially responsible being subject to many interpretations. 'Government, industry and consumers
                        are all looking for product standards and criteria to help establish uniform technical
                        requirements, methods, processes, and practices that address sustainability' according to ANSI.
                        The Workshop brought together stakeholders to&nbsp;share insight into the market drivers and
                        identify&nbsp;key gaps and&nbsp;define the roles of&nbsp;product standards in
                        sustainability.</p>
                    <p>The workshop offered a neutral venue where all interested stakeholders can engage in discussions
                        that will support and facilitate the timely development, promulgation, and use of standards to
                        address sustainability issues related to products. 240 individuals attended in person during the
                        two-day workshop, and nearly 100 more participated by teleconference and webinar. ASTM
                        International and ANSI collaborates on such global standards setting initiatives.</p>
                    <p>In 2008, Lee participated in the first&nbsp;Green Meetings Initiative led&nbsp;by&nbsp;the US
                        Environmental Protection Agency and Green Meeting Industry Council (GMIC). The Green Meeting
                        Industry Council, the Convention Industry Council, the Environmental Protection Agency, and ASTM
                        International&nbsp;joined forces in 2008 to develop universal environmental standards for the
                        meetings and convention industry.</p>
