                    <p>Kelley is an associate of Kingport due to her interest in how people make decisions. Her
                        understanding of key considerations that individuals or groups assess throughout the
                        decision-making process surrounding key decisions has been invaluable. She assists in developing
                        protocols to understanding how to engage stakeholders in resource productivity improvements.
                        Kelleyâ€™s ability to graphically communicate the decision making process provides a unique way to
                        engage and obtain buy-in to resource efficiency. With her Master Degree in Clinical Psychology,
                        she advises Kingport on how to communicate with the marketplace and build awareness and
                        communicate resource efficiency and productivity in bite size to all. Her success in an energy
                        efficiency behavioral study she conducted while attending Carleton College provides her with a
                        keen understanding of how important it is to consider all human needs in the decision-making
                        process. Kelley has done in-depth research for Kingport on effective behavior
