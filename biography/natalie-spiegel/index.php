                    <p>Natalie Spiegel has worked on projects with Kingport since 2009. She has a keen interest in
                        resource productivity as the way to accelerate and enhance sustainability for organizations. In
                        2012, she conducted research for a statewide sustainability leadership training program for
                        executives: she prepared sections of a five-day presentation using the results of the
                        research. </p>
                    <p>Natalie joined the Sierra Club from 2013 to 2016 as a Research Analyst – Performed research and
                        analysis on practices, principles, and applications of environmental issues. Her experience at
                        the Sierra Club enabled Natalie to realize the ecological value of conservation and led her to
                        the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies for the fall of 2016. It is her strong
                        belief that the tremendous benefits of water/energy efficiency and resource efficiency are
                        linked to preservation of our earth as the better you use all resources, the less the impact on
                        nature. </p>
                    <p>She joined Kingport Corporation in 2009 to assist in utility technology assessments and quickly
                        realized the importance of properly managing a resource such as energy to improve the overall
                        financial health and wealth of an organization or a business.. Natalie’s interest in marketing
                        resource productivity as essential for long-term sustainability led her to develop market
                        specific outreach programs and action plans for organizations such as Bay-Area Environmentally
                        Aware Consulting Network, UC Berkeley.</p>
