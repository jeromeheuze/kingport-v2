                        effectiveness and long term financial benefits of all energy project development.</p><h4>
                        <strong>Assessment of Emerging Energy Technologies:</strong></h4>
                    <p>As a consultant for Fortune 500 companies, he views technology from a practitioner's viewpoint
                        based on more than 20 years of experience in facility and energy management.</p>
                    <p>His current work with the Emerging Technology Programs in the utility industry&nbsp;for San Diego
                        Gas &amp; Electric and Pacific Gas &amp;Electric consists of identifying, assessing and
                        validating electric energy emerging technologies. Instead of focusing on just the technologies,
                        his unique approach of engaging customers created excitement and enthusiasm for participation in
                        the projects ensuring their completion. Daryl has completed a major energy efficiency study for
                        The Travelers Insurance Companies which included completion of multiple projects in the
                        Travelers Hartford Tower Building.</p>
                    <p>Daryl is the author of over 30 emerging technologies assessment reports resulting from the
                        projects he managed for Pacific Gas &amp; Electric and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric. The reports
                        are published and available on the <a href="https://www.etcc-ca.com/">California Emerging
                            Technologies Coordinating Council website</a> (ETCC ). These assessment reports are used by
                        many organizations and companies as a frame of reference for implementing projects as the
                        potential performance of the technologies is evaluated at an end-user host site. In 2008, he
                        managed the hotel guest room DDC control technology assessment for&nbsp;San Diego Gas &amp;
                        Electric at four hotels&nbsp;located in San Diego for 18 months. He coordinated the installation
                        of systems,&nbsp;EM&amp;V and the report for this project.&nbsp;The report&nbsp;for this
                        assessment is published on the ETCC website at <a

                            Evaluation and Project Development for End-Users:</strong></h4>
                    <p>With the help of Emerging Technologies Associates, Travelers received three ENERGY STAR’s on
                        their Tower Building, Claim University and Fall River buildings. Claim University begun lighting
                        retrofits that are benchmarked in ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager: ETA set up profiles and trained
                        Travelers’s Facility team on the use of the Portfolio Manager Tool.</p>
                    <p><strong>Energy Performance Evaluation and Tracking:</strong></p>
                    <p>ETA has assisted in benchmarking over 12 million square feet of customers industrial, commercial
                        and government buildings. Daryl DeJean and Lee Stevens have been retained to assist with energy
                        management plans, strategies and implementation of energy performance-enhancing projects by
                        clients owning over 20 million square feet of buildings. The 30 plus projects recommended by
                        Daryl DeJean and Lee Stevens has gained Travelers Insurance points in ENERGY STAR with their
                        high score going up from 96 to 97 in 2010. Three ETA successful projects were recognized by US
                        EPA and published on the ENERGY STAR website:</p>

                    <h4>Public Outreach and Workforce Education and Training:</h4>
                    <p>Daryl DeJean shares his knowledge of building technologies in many public speaking events all
                        over the US with&nbsp;energy management consultants, directors of facilities, Facilities
                        managers and utility managers on the features and benefits of the ENERGY STAR program.</p>
                    <p>In 2014, Daryl DeJean and Lee Stevens co-authored a paper published by ASTM International
                        entitled “How E06.81 Promotes Meeting of the Minds” How standards promote adoption of energy
                        efficiency and innovation. The paper was presented by both Lee and Daryl at the 2014 ASTM E06.81
                        Symposium.</p>
                    <p>Daryl has given many speaking engagement to promote programs that drive market adoption of energy
                        efficiency at events sponsored by Building Owners Management Association, National Facilities
                        Management Association and International Facilities Management Association Events and Department
                        of Energy SSL Conferences.</p>
                    <p>In 2015, he was invited to speak at international Symposium sponsored by North Sea Conference and
                        Journal, to promote increased investment in energy efficiency. Daryl created the Conference
                        poster selected for worldwide outreach effort. Please refer to <a

                    <p>Daryl's cost-effective and practical approach&nbsp;to energy management continues to receive rave
                        reviews from all audiences on both&nbsp;Coasts of the US. Daryl continues to engage everyone
                        with&nbsp;the implementation steps necessary to achieve efficiency&nbsp;by sharing measures that
                        he implemented in the 200&nbsp;facilities that he managed for HILTI. The facilities included
                        computer data centers, cafeteria and plants, buildings that have challenging high intensity
                        energy use. The California Center for Sustainable Energy published on 11/23/2010 the highlights
                        of Daryl's ENERGY STAR's Best Practices seminar. The article entitled Affordable Steps to Boost
                        your ENERGY STAR Building Rating was&nbsp;published on the CleanTechies website at <a

                    <p>As a founding member of the California Advanced Lighting Control Program, Daryl DeJean has been
                        instrumental in working with NECA-IBEW and California utilities and higher education
                        institutions in creating a nationally recognized Green Workforce Training Program. The Program
                        not only created green jobs but ensures that energy efficiency projects deliver persistent
                        savings for many years.</p>

                    <h4>Market Development for Emerging Technologies and Collaboratives:</h4>
                    <p>As an active member of several&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;Department of Energy Solid-State Lighting
                        Committees,&nbsp;Daryl was selected to serve&nbsp;as a panel member to review the&nbsp;U. S.&nbsp;Department
                        of Energy Solid State Lighting Commercialization Initiative in 2009. In that capacity, he
                        stressed the crucial importance of customer expectations and acceptance in the technological
                        development of new LED products.</p>
                    <p><strong>Participation in Collaboratives:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Speaker at conferences such as the Consortium for Energy Efficiency to promote collaboration
                            amongst utility companies.
                        </li>
                        <li>Collaborated with energy research organizations such as New York State Energy Research and
                            Development Authority (NYSERDA), California Lighting Technology Center (CLTL) Western
                            Cooling Efficiency Center (WCEC), Rensselear Polytechnic Institute’s Lighting Research
                            Center (LRC).
                        </li>
                        <li>Share emerging technologies knowledge and processes with national laboratories such Pacific
                            Northwest National Laboratory.
                        </li>
                        <li>Worked closely with the Department of Energy Solid State Lighting (SSL) Commercial Market
                            Initiative to create collaborative efforts such as Gateway Demonstration, Technical
                            Information Network, Lighting Facts, DesignLights Consortium. Daryl was tasked to
                            recommending strategies to increase market penetration of the new Solid State Lighting
                            technology.
                        </li>
                        <li>In collaboration with San Diego Gas &amp; Electric’s Emerging Technology Program, led
                            the development of a regional municipal streetlight consortium that later became a national
                            consortium.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Believing that the establishment of global sustainability standards are important, he joined ASTM
                        International as a volunteer voting member of the Committee E60 Committee on Sustainability and
                        Committee E06 on Performance of Building. His passion for emerging energy efficiency
                        technologies led him to seek a formal forum for standards setting. Daryl believes that without
                        standards of performance whether it is function, design, sustainability or financial return, any
                        emerging technology in the energy efficiency field&nbsp;will not produce sustainable energy or
                        economic savings. He has been an active voting member alongside of many different stakeholders
                        ranging from Fortune 500 companies to Non-Profit Organizations who have a vision of a lesser
                        carbon world.</p>
                    <p>Daryl is a strong believer that the first and foremost step in reducing greenhouse gases is to
                        uncover breakthrough technologies in energy efficiency that accelerate and enhance
                        sustainability. He is a strong advocate of the energy plan adopted by&nbsp;California which&nbsp;established
                        a “loading order” of preferred resources. This plan&nbsp;places energy efficiency as the state's
                        top-priority procurement resource and set aggressive long-term goals for energy efficiency and
                        achieve greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. He has developed many can do leadership
                        training&nbsp;programs that has empowered facilities management teams to receive recognition for
                        their tremendous accomplishments and to allow them to continue to gain productivity. This
                        started at HILTI when Daryl integrated Datastream with the energy management system in place to
                        allow for projects to be tracked from a work order to completions of tasks: Datastream asked
                        Daryl to speak at their Annual User Conference one year to show their clients the
                        possibilities.</p>
                    <p>In April 2009, Daryl&nbsp;DeJean and Lee Stevens participated in the Workshop Toward Product
                        Standards for Sustainability&nbsp;organized by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI)
                        with the support of the US EPA. The workshop brought together 340&nbsp;stakeholders representing
                        standard developing organizations, consortia, industry, government and consumer groups to focus
                        on issues related to sustainability and environmental performance standards for products. For a
                        copy of the Final Report from the Workshop, you can click on the following link, ANSI Workshop
                        Toward Product Standards for Sustainability April 8-9, 2009. With today’s consumers shopping
                        with sustainability in mind,&nbsp;the concepts of green and socially responsible being subject
                        to many interpretations. &quot;Government, industry and consumers are all looking for
                        product standards and criteria to help establish uniform technical requirements, methods,
                        processes, and practices that address sustainability&quot; according to ANSI. The Workshop
                        brought together stakeholders to&nbsp;share insight into the market drivers and identify&nbsp;key
                        gaps and&nbsp;define the roles of product standards in sustainability.</p>
                    <p>The workshop offered a neutral venue where all interested stakeholders can engage in discussions
                        that will support and facilitate the timely development, promulgation, and use of standards to
                        address sustainability issues related to products. 240 individuals attended in person during the
                        two-day workshop, and nearly 100 more participated by teleconference and webinar. ASTM
                        International and ANSI collaborate on such global standards setting initiatives.</p><h4>Facility
                        Management:</h4>
                    <p>As Director of Facilities and Energy for Hilti, Daryl's ability to evaluate and demonstrate that
                        project benefits and return on investment extended beyond energy savings into other areas such
                        as improvements in employee comfort and productivity or corporate image resulted in obtaining
                        the executive buy in on energy efficiency projects. Under Daryl's leadership, energy management
                        was integrated into the organization's structure as part of its core business. The productivity
                        gains came from improved manufacturing process and better working conditions. In addition, Daryl
                        led several cultural changes that resulted in phenomenal productivity gains throughout the
                        Company. He also created several collaborative teams to ensure adoption and acceptance of
                        changes.&nbsp;Ms. Rosalia C. Cunningham, M.A., PHR, Director, Organizational Development/Chief
                        Spirit Sherpa for Hilti, Inc. best describes Daryl&nbsp;as follows:</p>
                    <p>"Daryl's keen vision was evident when he successfully led change efforts by creating a new
                        culture within his team, Facilities and Administrative Operations, by redefining and reassigning&nbsp;roles
                        and responsibilities that led to operational efficiency, effectiveness, and excellence while
                        improving profitability and resource productivity. &nbsp;He didn't stop there, as he also
                        renamed his department which created a departmental brand."</p>
